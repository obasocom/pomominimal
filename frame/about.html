      <p class="question2">Q: what is my targeted audience?</p>
      <p class="answer2">A: Wait what, what is happening</p>
      <p class="question2">
        Q: correct! now can you tell me why my 
        <br>targeted audience is people who are looking for
        <br>a simple study website with a minimalistic appearance
        <br>that reduces distractions for any time they choose to 
        <br>study?</p>
      <p class="answer2">A: Wait this website is meant to help people study?</p>
      <p class="question2">
        Q: exactly! you're on a role This website is inspired
        <br>by the 'pomodoro' study technique which literally translates to
        <br>"tomato". isn't that funny?
      </p>
      <p class="answer2">A: Ohhh so that's where the "pomo" in 'pomominial' comes from.
        <br>I mean that is kinda funny, is that supposed to be a question?
      </p>
      
      <p class="question2">
        Q: what is the 'pomodoro' technique anyways<br>you ask?
      </p>
      <p class="answer2">
        A: No, I didn't ask that. Hey don't you think this whole 
        <br>dialogue thing is counter intuitive given the whole 
        <br>purpose of this website is to...
        <br> y'know...
        <br> NOT distract people. 
      </p>
      <p class="question2">
        Q: yes! how did you know that the 'pomdoro' study technique is <br>
        when you set aside (usually) 25 min of time and begin <br>
        a series of tasks you deem to be productive. what happens after the 25 min are up?<br>
      </p>
      <p class="answer2">A: Wait, Q&A's aren't supposed to be structured like this.
        <br>you can't do this
      </p>
      <p class="question2">
        Q: yup! after a 25 min study session with 0 distraction, you take 5 minutes to enjoy yourself 
        <br> so that after the 5 minute break you go right back into another 'pomodoro' (25 min study sess).
      </p>
      <p class="answer2">
