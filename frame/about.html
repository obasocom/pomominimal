      <p class="question2">Q: what is my targeted audience?</p>
      <p class="answer2">A: Wait what, what is happening</p>
      <p class="question2">
        Q: correct! now can you tell me why my
        <br />targeted audience is people who are looking for <br />a simple
        study website with a minimalistic appearance <br />that reduces
        distractions for any time they choose to <br />study?
      </p>
      <p class="answer2">A: Wait this website is meant to help people study?</p>
      <p class="question2">
        Q: exactly! you're on a role This website is inspired
        <br />by the 'pomodoro' study technique which literally translates to
        <br />"tomato". isn't that funny?
      </p>
      <p class="answer2">
        A: Ohhh so that's where the "pomo" in 'pomominial' comes from. <br />I
        mean that is kinda funny, is that supposed to be a question?
      </p>

      <p class="question2">
        Q: what is the 'pomodoro' technique anyways<br />you ask?
      </p>
      <p class="answer2">
        A: No, I didn't ask that. Hey don't you think this whole
        <br />dialogue thing is counter intuitive given the whole <br />purpose
        of this website is to... <br />
        y'know... <br />
        NOT distract people.
      </p>
      <p class="question2">
        Q: yes! how did you know that the 'pomdoro' study technique is <br />
        when you set aside (usually) 25 min of time and begin <br />
        a series of tasks you deem to be productive. what happens after the 25
        min are up?<br />
      </p>
      <p class="answer2">
        A: Wait, Q&A's aren't supposed to be structured like this. <br />you
        can't do this
      </p>
      <p class="question2">
        Q: yup! after a 25 min study session with 0 distraction, you take 5
        minutes to enjoy yourself
        <br />
        so that after the 5 minute break you go right back into another
        'pomodoro' (25 min study sess).
      </p>
      <p class="answer2">
        A: Oh sweet!.. Wait you didn't ask a question that time..
      </p>
      <p class="question2">Q: ...</p>
      <p class="answer2">A: um hello?</p>

        <br />audience more about what 'Pomdoro' is<br />
